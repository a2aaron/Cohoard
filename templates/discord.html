{#- "safe" keyword is required here, because messages will
   sometimes contain newlines, which we add <br>s to. 
   By default, Tera will escape these tags into literal 
   text, but we don't want this (we want actual html tags
   for the newline), so we need to tell Tera that this is
   safe to not escape (even though, technically, it is not.
   This also means that messages that contain literal text
   of HTML tags will end up rendered as actual HTML tags.
   If you want to type HTML tags (that aren't inside code
   blocks), you can escape it with &lt;. -#}
