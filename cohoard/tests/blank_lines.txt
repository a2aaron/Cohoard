@ Blank Lines (with br tags)
AARON: this test case uses br tags because we don't handle new lines correctly right now.
AARON: the main issue is that the markdown parser wants to turn contigious newlines into p tags which also means it keeps eating newlines, which is kind of annoying
AARON: the solution might be to instead write our own *inline* markdown parser, which only handles a small subset of markdown (rather than the like, 40 billion edge cases we'd have to handles)
AARON: however that also sounds hard.
